# RecipeManagerWebApp
Recipe Manager is a web application that allows users to create, edit, and manage their favorite recipes. Users can add a recipe, view all recipes, filter by category (breakfast, lunch, dinner), and delete them. Built using HTML for structure, CSS for layout, and JavaScript for interactivity, it helps in practicing core web development skills.
